# H3

💡 H3 runs on more JavaScript runtimes than just Node.js. Right now, Zen only supports Node.js. Using [`npx listhen`](https://github.com/unjs/listhen) is currently not supported

At the very beginning of your app.js file, add the following line:

```js
require("@aikidosec/firewall"); // <-- Include this before any other code or imports

const { createApp, toNodeListener } = require("h3");
const { createServer } = require("http");

const app = createApp();

...

// Using `npx listhen` is currently not supported
createServer(toNodeListener(app)).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);

...

// ...
```

or ESM import style:

```js
import "@aikidosec/firewall";

// ...
```

## Blocking mode

By default, the firewall will run in non-blocking mode. When it detects an attack, the attack will be reported to Aikido if the environment variable `AIKIDO_TOKEN` is set and continue executing the call.

You can enable blocking mode by setting the environment variable `AIKIDO_BLOCK` to `true`:

```sh
AIKIDO_BLOCK=true node app.js
```

It's recommended to enable this on your staging environment for a considerable amount of time before enabling it on your production environment (e.g. one week).

## Rate limiting and user blocking

If you want to add the rate limiting feature to your app, modify your code like this:

```js
const Zen = require("@aikidosec/firewall");

const app = createApp();

// Optional, if you want to use user based rate limiting or block specific users
app.use(defineEventHandler((event) => {
  // Get the user from your authentication middleware
  // or wherever you store the user
  Zen.setUser({
    id: "123",
    name: "John Doe", // Optional
  });

}));

// Call this as early as possible, before other middleware
Zen.addH3Middleware(app);

app.get(...);
```

## Debug mode

If you need to debug the firewall, you can run your express app with the environment variable `AIKIDO_DEBUG` set to `true`:

```sh
AIKIDO_DEBUG=true node app.js
```

This will output debug information to the console (e.g. if the agent failed to start, no token was found, unsupported packages, ...).

## Preventing prototype pollution

Zen can also protect your application against prototype pollution attacks.

Read [Protect against prototype pollution](./prototype-pollution.md) to learn how to set it up.

That's it! Your app is now protected by Zen.

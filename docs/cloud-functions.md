# Google Cloud Functions

If you're using the `@google-cloud/functions-framework` package to register your handlers, your cloud function will be protected by Zen automatically:

```js
require("@aikidosec/firewall/cloud-function"); // <-- Include this before any other code or imports

const functions = require("@google-cloud/functions-framework");

functions.http("handler", async (req, res) => {
  // ...
});
```

or ESM import style:

```js
import "@aikidosec/firewall/cloud-function";

// ...
```

If you're using the `exports.handler` style, you'll need to wrap your handler manually.

At the very beginning of the file that contains your handler, add the following line:

```js
const protect = require("@aikidosec/firewall/cloud-function"); // <-- Include this before any other code or imports

const dependency = require("dependency");

exports.handler = protect(async (event, context) => {
  // <-- Wrap your handler with protect
  // ...
});
```

or ESM import style:

```js
import protect from "@aikidosec/firewall/cloud-function";

// ...
```

That's it! Your cloud function is now protected by Zen.

If you want to see a full example, check our [cloud functions sample app](../sample-apps/cloud-functions-v1-mongodb).

## Blocking mode

By default, the firewall will run in non-blocking mode. When it detects an attack, the attack will be reported to Aikido and continue executing the call.

You can enable blocking mode by setting the environment variable `AIKIDO_BLOCKING` to `true`.

It's recommended to enable this on your staging environment for a considerable amount of time before enabling it on your production environment (e.g. one week).

## Debug mode

If you need to debug the firewall, you can run your cloud function with the environment variable `AIKIDO_DEBUG` set to `true`.

This will output debug information to the console (e.g. if the agent failed to start, no token was found, unsupported packages, ...).

## Data reporting

To minimize impact on function execution time, Zen reports data to the Aikido platform on the first invocation and then every 10 minutes.

Attack events are reported immediately when they occur.

## Timeout configuration

By default, Zen uses a 1-second timeout for API requests to minimize impact on function execution time.

If you're experiencing timeout errors (e.g., due to slow network connections or specific GCP regions), you can increase the timeout using the `AIKIDO_CLOUD_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable:

```bash
AIKIDO_CLOUD_FUNCTION_TIMEOUT_MS=5000  # 5 seconds
```

## Preventing prototype pollution

Zen can also protect your application against prototype pollution attacks.

Read [Protect against prototype pollution](./prototype-pollution.md) to learn how to set it up.

# Restify

At the very beginning of your app.js file, add the following line:

```js
require("@aikidosec/firewall"); // <-- Include this before any other code or imports

const restify = require("restify");

const server = restify.createServer({
  name: "my-app",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// ...
```

or ESM import style:

```js
import "@aikidosec/firewall";

// ...
```

## Blocking mode

By default, the firewall will run in non-blocking mode. When it detects an attack, the attack will be reported to Aikido if the environment variable `AIKIDO_TOKEN` is set and continue executing the call.

You can enable blocking mode by setting the environment variable `AIKIDO_BLOCK` to `true`:

```sh
AIKIDO_BLOCK=true node app.js
```

It's recommended to enable this on your staging environment for a considerable amount of time before enabling it on your production environment (e.g. one week).

## Rate limiting and user blocking

If you want to add the rate limiting feature to your app, modify your code like this:

```js
const Zen = require("@aikidosec/firewall");
const restify = require("restify");

const server = restify.createServer({
  name: "my-app",
  version: "1.0.0",
});

// Optional middleware to set user for rate limiting or blocking specific users
server.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Get the user from your authentication middleware
  // or wherever you store the user
  Zen.setUser({
    id: "123",
    name: "John Doe", // Optional
  });

  return next();
});

// Call this after your auth middleware, before other middleware
Zen.addRestifyMiddleware(server);

server.get("/", (req, res, next) => {
  // Your route handlers
});
```

## Debug mode

If you need to debug the firewall, you can run your Restify app with the environment variable `AIKIDO_DEBUG` set to `true`:

```sh
AIKIDO_DEBUG=true node app.js
```

This will output debug information to the console (e.g. if the agent failed to start, no token was found, unsupported packages, ...).

## Preventing prototype pollution

Zen can also protect your application against prototype pollution attacks.

Read [Protect against prototype pollution](./prototype-pollution.md) to learn how to set it up.

That's it! Your app is now protected by Zen.  
If you want to see a full example, check our [Restify sample app](../sample-apps/restify-postgres).

## Graceful shutdown

It is recommended to add a shutdown handler to your app to ensure that no statistics are lost when the app is stopped. You can find more information [here](./graceful-shutdown.md).

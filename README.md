Zen, your in-app firewall for peace of mind– at runtime.

Zen by Aikido is an embedded Web Application Firewall that autonomously protects Node.js apps against common and critical attacks.

It protects your Node.js apps by scanning user input and where that data eventually flows to, allowing Zen to more accurately block SQL Injections, Path traversal attacks, and more. It runs on the same server as your Node.js app for simple [installation](#installation) and zero maintenance.

## Features

Zen will autonomously protect your Node.js applications against:

* 🛡️ [NoSQL injection attacks](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/web-application-security-vulnerabilities)
* 🛡️ [SQL injection attacks](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/the-state-of-sql-injections)
* 🛡️ [Command injection attacks](https://www.aikido.dev/blog/command-injection-in-2024-unpacked)
* 🛡️ [Prototype pollution](./docs/prototype-pollution.md)
* 🛡️ [Path traversal attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)
* 🛡️ [Server-side request forgery (SSRF)](./docs/ssrf.md)
* 🛡️ JS injection

Zen operates autonomously on the same server as your Node.js app to:

* ✅ Secure your app like a classic web application firewall (WAF), but with none of the infrastructure or cost.
* ✅ Auto-generate API specifications
* ✅ Block known threat actors and bots.
* ✅ Geo-fencing to block or allow a selection of countries
* ✅ Rate limit specific API endpoints by IP or by user
* ✅ Allow you to block specific users manually

## Reporting to your Aikido Security dashboard

> Aikido is your no nonsense application security platform. One central system that scans your source code & cloud, shows you what vulnerabilities matter, and how to fix them - fast. So you can get back to building.

Zen improves Aikido's offering by providing you with security in production. Use the automatic generation of API specifications together with our DAST offering for even better API Security.

Only the necessary data gets reported back to Aikido, we scan your requests locally and only report back data once every 10 minutes.
If an attack on your application is detected, we report immediately allowing you to take swift action.

You can easily select which IP addresses and/or bots to block from curated lists inside our Dashboard.


You will need an Aikido account and a token to report events to Aikido. If you don't have an account, you can [sign up for free](https://app.aikido.dev/login). (No credit card required)

Here's how:
* [Log in to your Aikido account](https://app.aikido.dev/login).
* Go to [Zen](https://app.aikido.dev/runtime/services).
* Go to apps.
* Click on **Add app**.
* Choose a name for your app.
* Click **Generate token**.
* Copy the token.
* Set the token as an environment variable, `AIKIDO_TOKEN`, using [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) or another method of your choosing.

## Running in production (blocking) mode

By default, Zen will only detect and report attacks to Aikido.

To block requests, set the `AIKIDO_BLOCK` environment variable to `true`.

See [Reporting to Aikido](#reporting-to-your-aikido-security-dashboard) to learn how to send events to Aikido.

## Additional configuration

[Configure Zen using environment variables for authentication, mode settings, debugging, and more.](https://help.aikido.dev/doc/configuration-via-env-vars/docrSItUkeR9)
